## Problem Descriptions

### Problem-1: Calculator using Class
- Implements a calculator using a class
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Inputs:
  - a (double)
  - b (double)
  - operation (string)
- Handles division by zero

---

### Problem-2: Generate Odd Number Series
- Input: single integer `a`
- Output: first `a` odd numbers starting from 1

Example:  
Input: 4  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7

---

### Problem-3: Conditional Odd Number Series
- Input: single integer `a`
- If `a` is odd → generate `a` odd numbers
- If `a` is even → generate odd numbers till `a-1`

Examples:  
Input: 3 → Output: 1, 3, 5  
Input: 4 → Output: 1, 3, 5  

---

### Problem-4: Count Multiples in a List
- Input: predefined list of integers
- Output: dictionary showing the count of numbers divisible by each number from 1 to 9

Example Output:  
{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
